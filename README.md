# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.



## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Player 1 starts the game by clicking on an empty cell in the grid.
3. Player 2 then takes their turn by clicking on another empty cell.
4. Players continue taking turns until one player wins by getting three of their marks in a row, or there are no more empty cells left (a draw).
5. To start a new game, refresh the page.
